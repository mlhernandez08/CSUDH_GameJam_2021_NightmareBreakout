Entry for CSUDH Gamejam 2021

# Theme: Expect the Unexpected

Nightmare Breakout is a sidescrolling platforming game developed in Gamemaker Studio 2. The team implemented the theme of the gamejam by creating a somewhat roguelike game experience. As the player exits the starting area, they are transported into one of several different video game themes/environments. As the player progresses through the game each section is randomly chosen from a set of possibilities within their current theme. Should the player die, they restart at the start of the game and upon exiting the starting area, they will be transported into a possible different theme from their last play through. The game ends at a final boss in which the room will be a mix of all the available themes in the game.

The game was created with help from the tutorial series: https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-make-tile-based-platform-games-with-gamemaker/

The team followed the tutorial in order to learn how to use Gamemaker Studio 2's  features and to get an understanding on the game development process. Much of the code found in this game came from knowledge gained from this tutorial.
